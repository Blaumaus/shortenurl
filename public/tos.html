    <h1>Term of Services</h1>
    <h2>Use of Personal Information</h2>
    Uri.vg does not sell, rent or lease its users lists to third parties. <br>
    Uri.vg will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good
    faith belief that such action is necessary to: 
    <ol type="a">
        <li>conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on uri.vg</li>
        <li>protect and defend the rights or property of uri.vg (including enforcing this agreement)</li>
        <li>act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of uri.vg, or the public.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Links</h2>
    URL shortening is a tool for managing web addresses. Users can make simplified addresses that essentially become
    links to other web pages. <br>
    A link does not indicate uri.vg's endorsement of or affiliation with that website. A redirect or link is simply a
    shortcut. <br>
    Linking is not the same as hosting material. No data or files outside of the uri.vg domain are ever stored or hosted
    on our servers. <br>
    Uri.vg is not responsible for the content of external sites or resources that are redirected by our service. <br>
    As a user of our service <strong>if you make a link, you are responsible for what you do with it!</strong>

    <h2>Copyright</h2>
    No content may be copied or reproduced from this site without our prior permission.

    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    Uri.vg is a free service, supported by Ad revenue and donations. It is provided without warranty of any kind. <br>
    There are no guarantees that it will be available at any given time, and no guarantees that the site or service will
    not be subject to interruptions. <br>
    All direct or indirect risk related to use of this site is borne entirely by you, the user. <br>
    Uri.vg only provides the technology to shorten web addresses. A short URL by itself holds no content. <br>
    It simply forwards the browser on to an external web page. Short URLs are links to other websites... all created and
    shared by users of our service. <br>
    Uri.vg is not the source of any content or the sharing. <br>
    We are not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy of external websites or user-generated
    content. <br>
    We don't send out promotional emails, SMS texts, or newsletters of any kind - so there is nothing to unsubscribe. <br>
    If you received spam containing the uri.vg domain, regretfully it was the work of abusers! <br>
    Such as bulk email campaigns or attempts to hide malware or phishing behind a uri.vg link. <br>
    Please send us the link so that abuse of our service can be investigated. <br>
    <strong>We reserve the right to amend or change these policies, terms and conditions at any time and without prior notice.</strong>

    <h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2>
    The only personal information we record is an email address, which is used to verify your account at registration. <br>
    Account passwords are stored using an encrypted algorithm. This means your password can not be read by us. So if you
    forgot it, we unfortunately can't re-send it. <br> We're not interested in collecting user information. We do not sell,
    expose or share any of your personal information unless required by law. When you look at the uri.vg web site our
    server may record browser transactions which are used for statistical purposes only. <br>

    When you create a shorten link, we record your internet protocol (IP) addresse, user-agent and date/time stamp. <br>

    Uri.vg has no access to or control over cookies that are used by third-party advertisers. <br>

    You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers for more detailed information on
    their practices as well as for instructions about how to opt-out of certain practices. <br>
    Uri.vg's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or external web sites. <br>
    If you wish to disable cookies, you may do so through your individual browser options. More detailed information
    about cookie management with specific web browsers can be found at the browsers' respective websites.
